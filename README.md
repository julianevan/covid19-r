# covid19-r
A Data Analytics Project on Covid-19 dataset using R 

Hi! Welcome to this repository! This is a Data Analytics Project on Covid-19 dataset from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus), which is available in the repository too.
I used R and RStudio for this project. Feel free to download the repo and play with the R code.

# Overview
This project uses regression to check causality between dependent variables such as life expectancy, diabetes, cardiovascular deaths and total deaths caused by COVID-19.
