# covid19-r
A Data Analytics Project on Covid-19 dataset using R 

Hi! Welcome to this repository! This is a Data Analytics Project on Covid-19 dataset from [Google](https://health.google.com/covid-19/open-data/raw-data), which is available in the repository too.
I used R and RStudio for this project. Feel free to download the repo and play with the R code.

# Overview
This project uses regression to check causality between variables such as population density, population, number of fully vaccinated people, human development index, and life expectancy and total deaths caused by COVID-19.

A writeup will be written in Medium, the link will be updated here once it is finished.
